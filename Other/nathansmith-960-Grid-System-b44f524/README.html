<p>Created by Nathan Smith. See the official site for more info: <a href="http://960.gs">http://960.gs</a></p>
<p>To install the Adobe Fireworks extension, simply double-click the <code>*.mxp</code> file
included in the <code>/fireworks_extension directory</code>. If you are running Windows 7
you will need admin permissions in order to install this extension properly.</p>

<p>Thank you for downloading the 960 Grid System. I hope it helps to streamline
web development workflow. Enclosed in the bundle are printable sketch sheets
and template files for Adobe Fireworks and Photoshop, OmniGraffle and Visio.</p>
<p>Also included is a lightweight CSS file, which contains the grid dimensions.
To use this file, simply include the <code>960.css</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the HTML page.
You may also use the <code>reset.css</code> and <code>text.css</code> files, or opt to leave them out.
Here is an example of the XHTML code necessary to incorporate the CSS files:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;head&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot; href=&quot;css/reset.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot; href=&quot;css/text.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot; href=&quot;css/960.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It is worth noting that these styles do not automatically make up a finished
site design. They are simply a starting point, ideally for rapid prototyping
or as a basis for creating your own designs. You should not feel constrained
by the way I have built the initial code. If you disagree with how something
has been done, feel free to revise it for the needs of your particular site.</p>

<p>Note that if you are building a site in a language which reads from right to
left, use the CSS files that end in <code>_rtl.css</code> instead. Denote the language:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;html lang=&quot;...&quot; dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to set <code>lang=&quot;...&quot;</code> to the appropriate two-letter abbreviation of the
language you are using. Example: lang=&quot;he&quot; for Hebrew, lang=&quot;ar&quot; for Arabic.</p>
